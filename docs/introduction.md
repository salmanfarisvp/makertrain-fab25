# üçÄ Welcome to Maker Train!


**MakerTrain** is a hands-on workshop series designed to help you explore and build real-world IoT and embedded systems projects using cellular-connected hardware, the Nordic Thingy:91X.

This workshop is part of the **FAB25 MakerTrain Experience** and is organized by **Jinger Zeng**, **Sachin Soni**, and **Salman Faris** passionate community leaders and makers who are excited to share their knowledge and help you get started with powerful tools and ideas.

In this workshop, you'll explore the [Nordic Thingy:91X](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/Nordic-Thingy-91-X) to build connected solutions using cellular, GNSS, and sensor technologies. You'll also get introduced to key concepts in IoT, data transmission, and hardware prototyping using  [Zephyr RTOS](https://www.zephyrproject.org//).
