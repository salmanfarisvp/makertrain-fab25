By Following this [hackster guide](https://www.hackster.io/Salmanfarisvp/1-makertrain-pre-departure-checklist-nrf-sdk-setup-e37098), or below steps , please install necessary tools for the workshop.

###  Step 1. Install SEGGER J-Link v8.18
Download the installer for your platform from [SEGGER J-Link Software](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack). Run the installer; when you reach the ‚ÄòChoose Optional Components‚Äô window during installation, be sure to select ‚ÄòInstall Legacy USB Driver for J-Link‚Äô This driver is necessary for some supported Development Kits.

### Step 2. Install nrfutil and the nrfutil device command
Download the binary compatible with your OS from the [nRF Util product page](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Util/Download?lang=en#infotabs) and store it somewhere on your disk drive

**For windows:** `C:\nordic_tools\nrfutil.exe` and then

:::note

(Windows) Update your system‚Äôs **PATH** to include the location where **nrfutil** is stored. Open Edit environment variable for your account and add the path where you stored the **nrfutil binary**, as shown below:

:::

![Edit environment variable for your account](https://hackster.imgix.net/uploads/attachments/1853002/update_path_fIz9C3BmAJ.gif)

**For macOS or Linux:** You can store it in a folder that is already added in the system‚Äôs **PATH**.

The `nrfutil` binary you just downloaded does not come with any pre-installed commands. In this step, we will upgrade the core `nrfutil` and download the `device` command.

To make sure we have the latest `nrfutil` version, run the following command in a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell). It doesn‚Äôt matter which terminal since `nrfutil` is set globally.

```bash
nrfutil self-upgrade
```

and then run below command to install the device so we can flash binaries later.

```bash
nrfutil install device
```

You should see the following output :

```bash
[00:00:02] ###### 100% [Install packages] Install packages
```
